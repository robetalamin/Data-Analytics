#KEY FINDINGS
#People walk most on Saturdays closely followed by Tuesdays.
#people walk least on Sundays.
#the average number of steps is 7645
#the number of steps are likely to vary based on ones age, occupation,
#sex, height and stride. The data should be added fo furhur analysis
#most time is sedentary which we presume they are a working class who do 
#most of their work sit in an office.


#on average, people are more active between 5ppm and 7pm in the evening.
#peoples are least active at night, which we assume they are asleep.
#there is a high intensity at noon meaning people might be exercise
#while going out to look for lunch.

#trends throughout the working weekdays are almost similar
#Monday, Tuesday has people active from 4 to 7 pm
#Saturday has many people active at around 1pm.
