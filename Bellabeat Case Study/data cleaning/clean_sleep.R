# Conclusion:
# The sleep daily dataset contains the how many times they sleep, how long they stay in bed
# and how long they are really sleeping of each of the 24 Fitbit users each day from 2016-04-12 to 2016-05-12.
# But the completeness of this data set is only around 55.11%.

# we can see from the results of the codes above that the minute_sleep dataset contains four 
# columns, which are Id, date, value and logId. And the values in the "value" column is 1,2 and 3.
# But I can't identify the relationship between value and sleep without further explanation of
# the data owner. So I've decided that this dataset won't be used in the analysis this time.
