## Case Study 1 - How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?

### 1. Context

In this case study, the challenge is to understand how a bike-share company can increase the number of annual memberships. For this, the company needs to understand:

* the differences between a casual rider and an annual member
* why a casual member would buy an annual membership
* how the marketing department can use digital media to influence casual members

The main sponsor for this analysis is the department of Marketing, which will be responsible for developing a new marketing strategy based on the insights of this project to convert casual riders into annual members.
