## Case Study How Does a Bike-Share Navigate Speedy Success?

### 1. Context

In this case study, the challenge is to understand how a bike-share company can increase the number of annual memberships. For this, the company needs to understand:

* the differences between a casual rider and an annual member
* why a casual member would buy an annual membership
* how the marketing department can use digital media to influence casual members

The main sponsor for this analysis is the department of Marketing, which will be responsible for developing a new marketing strategy based on the insights of this project to convert casual riders into annual members.

### 2. Data Frame

For this task, I use bike ride dataset from Motivate International Inc. under this [license](https://www.divvybikes.com/data-license-agreement), available in [Divvy Trip](https://divvy-tripdata.s3.amazonaws.com/index.html) and Chicago temperature from [Climate-Data.ORG](https://en.climate-data.org/north-america/united-states-of-america/illinois/chicago-1574). 

### 3. Analysis Steps

The project uses the Google process for data analysis, divided into six steps:

1. **Ask**: define de problem to be solved

2. **Prepare**: understand and organize the data

3. **Process**: transform, clean and verify the data

4. **Analyze**: identify patterns, make predictions and draw conclusions

5. **Share**: communicate the insights with others using data storytelling

6. **Act**: apply the insights and solve the initial problem
